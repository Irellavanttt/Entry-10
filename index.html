 <P class="lead text-center">
    In this era, we experience the phenomenon of “buildstone.” Buildstone is a term used to describe when you incorporate restone contraptions into your base in Minecraft. For those who do not know what redstone is, it allows players to create automated doors, farms, etc. When using it, the player must have a good understanding of redstone pulses or, in the real world, the equivalent of electrical pulses, to work in tandem with their machine they are programming.

    Using this machinery in the building scene was usually limited to lighting fixtures or, for some, to using the blocks in the machines for aesthetic purposes, such as an auto crafter as a table or the side of a dispenser as a wall decoration. This was the extent to which restone was used in building for most, until Jake Kelton Crafts.

    Jake is a restone engineer who also has a love for building. He also, like many people in the Minecraft community, is a fan of Hermitcraft. During Hermitcraft season 10, Mumbo Jumbo was creating a base, which is described in detail in the era of the arts entry. On the side of Mumbo’s Mega Corp factory, there was a fan, but it wasn’t moving. Jake then had the idea to find a way to make the fan move.

  <P class="lead text-center">
    When Jake posted this video, it took the restone community by storm. The video gained thousands of views overnight and was an instant hit. This has led Jake to continue this path of buildstone, and now he has over 20 videos since he released his redesign of Mumbo’s fan. 

 </P>

  <P class="lead text-center">
    Mumbo saw this video that Jake had released and was inspired to experiment with buildstone extensively. He made three videos on animated fans and gears alone. It became his newest obsession, and he fully dove into it. Now, with the extensive storyline discussed in entry 9, Mumbo realised he needed a way to emote himself once he uploaded his consciousness to the Mega Corp supercomputer.

    This led him to create a face on something that looked similar to a computer screen overlooking his town. This face not only would make different faces over the span of three minutes, but it also had a box next to it where text would appear in one-letter intervals. Unfortunately, in the Hermitcraft season 10 world download, it does not work properly. With this new obsession, Mumbo brought buildstone outside of the redstone audience and into the builders scene as well.

    With Mumbo introducing this to a larger audience, Grian, who is one of Mumbo’s best friends, saw what his friend was creating and realised he could do something similar on a smaller scale. By using dispensers to dispense and destroy powdered snow it created the illusion of water droplets. Grian still believed this wasn’t enough, however, and decided to add arrows with potion effects to be floating at the bottom of the waterfall. By doing this, the bubbles give the illusion of water splashing against the river down below.

    This era is revolutionary, and as it continues to grow, it will continue to bring more life to the building. As this is the current build era we are in, Copper Golems are being utilised as workers in the mines or bartenders in a tavern. This era will only continue to grow more and more, and I, for one, am so excited to see where this goes. There will always be more the build, history will always continue.
